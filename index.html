  <h3 class="title">Microcomputers and Robotics</h3>
  <p> Microcomputers and robots are teaching aids, but also means of acquiring knowledge skills that can be applied in all subjects.
     For students, learning with microcomputer and robot fun, and just such motivation is the strongest prerequisite successful teaching. 
    This is an effective way of adopting the basics of programming where you are
    through play they learn to shape commands and think like an algorithm.</p>

      <p class="titlefirst-section">RoboticsTomina</p>
      <p>Association for Robotics "RoboticsTomina", abbreviated Association "RoboticsTomina" was founded in 2021 in order to provide education to young people in the field of modern technologies such as robotics, 
        automation and programming. The main mission of our association is to popularize robotics among young people and prepare them for work and technological challenges of the future. 
        The participants of our workshops are young interested students who acquire useful knowledge and skills by learning through play.
         We are constantly trying to keep up with trends in robotics and in the workshops we use modern tools adapted for working with children.
         Our programs are designed and adapted to the different ages and knowledge of our students and are written by experts, pedagogues and methodologists in the field of education in natural and technical sciences.</p>

      <p class="titlefirst-section">Ideas and Collaborations for the Future</p>
      <p>Idea for the future and cooperation for many years of work with young people we want to become partners,
         coordinators and participants in various projects and competitions in robotics such as; Croatian Makers League, National Competitions of Young Technicians (NMT), 
        First Lego League (FLL), World Robot Olympiad (WRO), Robokup and other similar robotics competitions.
        As an association, we are an active member of the Association of Technical Culture of the City of Split
         (ZTK Split), the Croatian Association of Technical Culture (HZTK) and the Croatian Robotics Association (HROBOS), with which we have been cooperating for one year.</p>

      <p class="titlefirst-section">Team members</p>
      <p>Our team includes experienced and professional leaders and lecturers, including professors and students of the University of Natural Sciences and Mathematics in Split, who are motivated and systematically transfer their knowledge and skills to their students.
        During the work we use modern methods and approaches in the work and teaching of children. We work in modernly equipped classrooms, adapted to work with students in small groups. </p>
